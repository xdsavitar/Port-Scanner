This Scans for open ports on a server you can use web domain or ip address:

first input is ip address / domain
second input is the ammout of ports u wanna scan from(1-65,535)

ps you have to run volscan.py and also can use port_scan.py for your program just put port_scan.py in your python project directory and import it
you need to call port_scan.main() function and pass 2 arguments (targets_ipAddress,target_port_scan_ammount) and the program should do the rest
